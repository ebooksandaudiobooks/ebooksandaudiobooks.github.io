	Reviews

	"Even if you only read 1 book per month, it's still worth that subscription." Joyce, Amsterdam

	"It is a surprise every time. There are books that I would not choose myself but I am still (usually) pleasantly surprised. So as for price/quality, is nothing better than Bookchoice. Even cooking, doing the dishes and cleaning is much more fun while I am listening to a book." Wendy, Nijmegen
